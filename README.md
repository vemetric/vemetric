## Self hosting

We're planning on supporting self hostable options of Vemetric in the future as a so called "Community Edition". It's still very early and we're currently focused on higher prioritized tasks.

We aren't sure yet which features will be available in the Community Edition, but it will definitely cover Web Analytics (everything you get in the [Dashboard](https://vemetric.com/docs/dashboard)), as well as [User Journeys](https://vemetric.com/docs/product-analytics/user-journeys).
